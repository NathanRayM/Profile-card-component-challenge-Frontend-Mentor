## About The Project

This is a perfect challenge to test your layout skills. The card layout doesn't shift, so it's also great for those that haven't dived into responsive websites yet!

## Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox and positioning
- Desktop-first workflow

## What I learned

In this challenge, I learned more about positioning background images in CSS. I also used positioning to place the elements accordingly.

## Useful resources
